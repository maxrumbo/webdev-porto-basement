# My-Portfolio-Basement

This repository serves as the foundational "basement" for my personal web portfolio. Currently, it's a work in progress, approximately **30% complete**, marking the end of **Day 3** of development.

The aim is to build a responsive and engaging online presence to showcase my projects and skills. Right now, you'll find the core structure being laid out using **HTML**, basic styling with **CSS**, a touch of interactivity through **JavaScript**, and the initial integration of **Font Awesome** icons.

-----

## Current Progress (Day 3)

At this stage, the focus has been on setting up the fundamental elements:

  * **HTML Structure**: The basic skeleton of the portfolio pages (e.g., home, about, projects) is being defined.
  * **CSS Styling**: Initial global styles, color schemes, and basic layout adjustments are in place. This includes font styling, spacing, and some responsive considerations for different screen sizes.
  * **JavaScript Basics**: Simple interactive elements might be present, like navigation toggles or basic content loading, to ensure the JS setup is functional.
  * **Font Awesome Integration**: A few essential icons from Font Awesome have been added to enhance the user interface, such as for navigation links or contact information.

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
  * **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
  * **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: For viewer-side interactivity.
  * **Font Awesome**: For scalable vector icons.
